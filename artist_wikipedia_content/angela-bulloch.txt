Angela Bulloch (born 1966 in Rainy River, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian artist who often works with sound and installation; she is recognised as one of the Young British Artists.[1] Bulloch lives and works in Berlin.[2]

Bulloch studied at Goldsmiths' College, London (1985–1988).[1] She was included in the Freeze Exhibition in 1988 and was established as one of the Young British Artists.[1] On reflecting on being a Young British Artist, Bulloch said "When I was 22, it was important for me. It was helpful in terms of managing media responses to my work because whenever I mentioned this little label, everyone was like, “Oh yeah, YBA”. But they were just talking about a media generated label, instead of the actual work. It's easier, isn't it? It's for lazy journalists."[3] In 1989 she won the Whitechapel Artists' Award.[4]

Bulloch undertook a two-month residency at ARCUS- project in Moriya, Japan in 1994.[4] She was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1997, part of an all-female shortlist that also included Cornelia Parker, Christine Borland and Gillian Wearing (who won the prize that year).[5] For the Turner Prize exhibition, Bulloch exhibited her playful artwork called Rules Series.[5] In 2005, she was nominated for the Preis der Nationalgalerie für junge Kunst.[6]

In 2002 Bulloch was awarded the ASEF (Asia-Europe Foundation) Cultural Grant.[4] Between 2001 and 2003 she undertook a guest professorship of sculpture at the Akademie für Bildende Künste, Vienna.[4]

Within her art, Bullock plays with the boundaries of mathematics and aesthetics.[1] She has a particular interest in instructions and rules, especially in the context of technology.[6] She is an ambiguous multi-disciplinary artist and has worked in multiple media, including video, installation, sculpture, painting.[7] In particular, she has used video, animation, sound and light to explore pre-edited systems.[8] Bulloch is recognised for her 'Pixel Boxes' originally constructed using beech wood and a plastic front screen and later with materials such as copper, aluminium or corian.[1] The boxes use different lights and colours to create a variety of abstract patterns.[1] Many of her works make use of biofeedback systems, such as in her 1994 work Betaville, a 'Drawing Machine' painting vertical and horizontal stripes on a wall, was triggered whenever someone sat on the bench in front of it.[9] Bulloch has also made a number of works using Belisha beacons, which are more commonly used to illuminate pedestrian crossings.[10] More recently, Bullock's Stacks are unique structures made of compiled rhomboids which play with light and colour to create optical effects.[1] Bullock's art commonly relies on the interpretation of the viewer, with its meaning being determined by their subjectivity.[11] A lot of her light and music works are developed using technology Bulloch has created herself.[12]

Bulloch is a fan of music and performs live.[3] She is also the owner of the record label LBCDLP.[3] Music is often incorporated into her art in a variety of ways such as light instillations that respond to a musical score.[3]

Since 2018 Bulloch is a professor of Time-Based Media at HFBK Hamburg.[12]

Bulloch exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago in 1997.[13] Other museum exhibitions include Kunsthaus Glarus (2001);[14] Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (2003);[15] Le Consortium, Dijon (2005);[16] Modern Art Oxford, Vienna Secession, and The Power Plant, Toronto (2005); and Lenbachhaus, Munich (2008).[17] Her work was also included in notable group exhibitions such as The New Decor at Hayward Gallery, London; Colour Chart: Reinventing Colour 1950 to Today at Tate Liverpool and Museum of Modern Art, New York; and Theanyspacewhatever for which she created an installation for the ceiling of Frank Lloyd Wright's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.[18]

Bulloch was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1997[21] and for the Preis der Nationalgalerie für junge Kunst in 2005.[22]

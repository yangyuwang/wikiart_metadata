Giuseppe Bruno (1836 in Capizzi â€“ 1904 in Taormina) was an Italian photographer who worked in Taormina, Capizzi and Sicily in the 19th century.

He was educated as an engineer and he married a rich woman. Living on her income he could dedicate himself to his passion: photography. At the time this  was a relatively new form of art, which required technical skills. He was keen on experimenting with new techniques of impression and printing of images. He even defined himself a "chemist-photographer".

He was teacher to Wilhelm von Gloeden, to whom he passed the passion for experimenting with the techniques of impression and printing of images.[1]

His production was mainly dedicated to landscapes and monuments of the local areas with the successful introduction of human figures in the sceneries.

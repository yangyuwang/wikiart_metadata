Houria Niati (born 1948) is an Algerian contemporary artist living in London.[1][2] Niati specializes in mixed media installations that criticize Western representations and objectification of north African and Middle Eastern women.[3] Her installations notably have live performances most commonly traditional Algerian music such as Raï, as a key visual representation of Niati's homeland and culture.[1] Salah M. Hassan further details her performances, "She uses synthesizers, sound recordings, and special light effects to create a theatrical atmosphere and a vibrant magical environment of sound, body movement, and color."[4] The installations and exhibitions join together paintings, sculptures, drawings, photos, soundtracks, and performances.[1]

Niati grew up in French-occupied Algeria, where over one million Algerians were killed for resisting occupation.[1] When Niati was twelve years old, she demonstrated against French colonialism with her anti-colonial graffiti, which landed her in jail.[1] Niati's experiences with the French occupation and eventual revolution of her people greatly influenced her art later in life.[1]

Niati moved to London in the late 1970s, where she observed Western art that depicted Algerian people, especially women, in a fictionalized and exotic way.[1] This influenced her own depictions of post-colonial cultures, nations, and people.[1] She attended Camden Arts Centre and Croydon College of Art,[5] and later went on to get an MA in Fine Arts at Middlesex University.[6]

Félix Labisse (March 9, 1905 – January 27, 1982) was a French Surrealist painter, illustrator, and designer.

He was born in Marchiennes. He divided his time between Paris and the Belgian coast from 1927.[1] In Ostend he met James Ensor, who influenced his work. Beginning in 1931 he designed for the theater.[1] His paintings depict fantastical hybrid creatures, and are often erotic. He painted the first of a series of blue women in 1960; among them is the Bain Turquoise.

He was the subject of a film by Alain Resnais, Visite à Félix Labisse (1947). In 1966 he was elected to the 
Académie des Beaux-Arts. In 1973 his paintings were shown in a retrospective exhibition at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1982.

Pedro Cabrita Reis (born September 5, 1956) is one of the foremost visual artists of his generation and also one of Portugal’s most internationally renowned artists.[1][2] His work features a wide variety of media – painting, sculpture, photography and drawing – and has been exhibited and included in numerous national and international museum collections. He lives and works in Lisbon.

Cabrita Reis studied at the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Lisbon. His first solo exhibition, “25 Desenhos” [25 Drawings], was held at the Sociedade Nacional de Belas Artes in 1981. While at university, he founded and directed the magazine Arte Opinião [Art Opinion] (1978-1982).[3]

In 1987, he held his first international solo exhibition, “Anima et Macula”, at Cintrik Gallery in Antwerp. Since then, he has taken part in important international exhibitions including documenta IX[4] and XIV[5] in Kassel (1992 and 2017) and the 21st and 24th São Paulo Biennials (1994 and 1998).

Cabrita Reis has also participated in various iterations of the Venice Biennale. He represented Portugal with Rui Chafes and José Pedro Croft in 1995, took part in Aperto at the 1997 Venice Biennale at Germano Celant’s invitation,[6] represented Portugal at the 2003 Venice Biennale and also showed another work on the same occasion at the Giardini at the invitation of Francesco Bonami.

In 2009, he participated in the 10th Lyon Biennial, “Le Spectacle du Quotidien”, with the work Les Dormeurs.[7][8] Returning to Venice in 2013, he presented A Remote Whisper in a solo show at the Palazzo Falier.[9]

In February 2022, at the invitation of the Louvre Museum and to mark the opening of the France-Portugal 2022 Season, he presented Les Trois Grâces in the Tuileries Garden,[10] an artwork comprises three cork sculptures each of which is around 4.5 m in height and 500 kilos in weight supported on an iron base weighing around 400 kilos. In 2022, Cabrita Reis will also make a return to Venice for the 59th Biennale, where he will present Field, a large-scale piece designed for the Chiesa di San Fantin.[11]

On 19 May 2024 he inaugurated his largest ever solo exhibition, "Atelier",[12] celebrating 50 years of work, a retrospective that brought together more than 1500 works from his personal collection made since the early 1970s, including almost two dozen that were made during the exhibition's assembly. The show occupied eight Mitra pavilions in Lisbon and was visited by 17801 people by 28 July, the closing date.[13]

Cabrita Reis’s career includes numerous solo and group exhibitions.

From the 1990s, Cabrita Reis began collecting Portuguese art and amassed 388 works by 74 artists representative of the “90s Generation”. In 2015, the foundation of the Portuguese electricity company EDP acquired this collection, “one of the most significant collections of Portuguese contemporary art from the last decade of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century.[18] “Germinal”, the first exhibition of the “Pedro Cabrita Reis Collection”, was first shown at the Galeria Municipal do Porto in 2018, followed that same year by a show in Lisbon at MAAT – Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology which included artworks by over thirty artists.[19][20]

Chen Hongshou (1598 Zhuji, Zhejiang province –1652), formerly romanized as Ch'en Hung-shou, was a Chinese painter of the late Ming dynasty.

Chen was born in Zhuji, Zhejiang province in 1598, during the Ming dynasty. His courtesy name was Zhanghou (章侯), and his  pseudonyms were Laolian (老莲), Fuchi (弗迟), Yunmenseng (云门僧), Huichi (悔迟), Chiheshang (迟和尚) and Huiseng (悔僧).[1] He once trained under Lan Ying, and was skilled in painting peculiar human figures, landscapes, flower-and-bird. He utilized plump, profound brushwork and precise color, creating a unique style. He always painted illustrations and made tapestry portraits. His two masterpieces, Shui Hu Ye Zi (水浒叶子) and Bo Gu Ye Zi, were the rare examples among the Ming and the Qing dynasties. He was very famous at that time, called "Chen in South and Cui in North", together with Cui Zizhong. He also was skilled in calligraphy, poetry and prose.

At the age of 9, Chen's father died, but his uncle bred and ensured his education. In 1645, he passed the government examinations, receiving official status, only to flee from the advancing Manchus. In 1646, he became a Buddhist monk; although he struggled in the sometimes conflicting ideals of Buddhist retirement or hermitage and Confucian government service.[2]

His works are kept in museums and galleries all over the world including these in the United States:

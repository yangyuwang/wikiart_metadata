Romero Britto (born October 6, 1963[1]) is a Brazilian artist, painter, serigrapher, and sculptor.[2] He combines elements of cubism, pop art, and graffiti painting in his work, using vibrant colors and bold patterns as a visual expression of hope, dreams, and happiness.

Britto was born in Recife, Brazil and grew up in poverty.[3][4] In 1983 he traveled to Europe to study art, where he was influenced by the works of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.[3] In 1988, he moved to Miami, where his current studio remains.[5] His first major commission was to design artwork for Absolut Vodka for a 1989 campaign.[3] In addition to his sculpture and fine art work, his designs have been used by Disney, BMW, IBM, Apple Computers, Grand Marnier, Pepsi, and Royal Caribbean Cruises, and been featured on a variety of consumer goods, such as Barbie dolls and pet collars.[4][3][5] According to a 2023 documentary about him, Britto is "the most collected and licensed artist in history."[4] Some of his public art installations are at Hyde Park, London, the O2 Arena in Berlin, and the John F. Kennedy Airport.[5] He also designed a Miami water park.[6]

Britto's charitable work has supported over 250 organizations.[7]

Britto is a conservative. In 2015 he hosted a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush at his Miami studio[8] where he unveiled a mural that he and Jeb Bush's wife Columba had painted with the slogan "#AllInForJeb".[9] Previously, Britto held a fundraiser at his gallery for 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.[10] He publicly supports Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro, and in March 2020 he gifted Bolsonaro with his own portrait.

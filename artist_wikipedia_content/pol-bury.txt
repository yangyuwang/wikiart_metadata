Pol Bury (26 April 1922 – 28 September 2005) was a Belgian sculptor who began his artistic career as a painter in the Jeune Peintre Belge and COBRA groups. Among his most famous works is the fountain-sculpture L'Octagon, located in San Francisco.[1]

In 1999, Louis Stern Fine Arts in West Hollywood, California, in cooperation with Galerie Louis Carré & Cie, Paris, exhibited Pol Bury: Fountains and Other Intriguing Works. This exhibition was part of the Absolut-L.A. International Biennial Art Invitational, which was also known as the L.A. International. The exhibition received a favorable review by critic David Pagel from the Los Angeles Times.[2]

His work was included in a 2008 auction at Christie's, the lot said to be the first of its kind in this kind of work.[3] Among other locations, Bury's work is included in the Chelsea Art Museum's permanent collection.

Jean Maurice Bompard (11 February 1857 – 1936) was a French Orientalist painter; one of the founders of the Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français.

He was born in Rodez. At a very young age, in 1865, his family moved to Marseille, where he later studied painting with Dominique Antoine Magaud. He then went to Paris, where he was a student of the Orientalist Gustave Boulanger and the history painter Jules Lefebvre, at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. His first exhibit was in 1878. Four years later, he obtained a grant that enabled him to visit Germany, Italy, Spain and Tunisia. 

Not long after returning, in 1889, he married Amélie Perretti, and they immediately set off for a three-month stay in Biskra. He would go there every winter for the next few years, until 1893, when the local people became suspicious of his activities.[citation needed] After that, until 1908, he wintered in Venice. In his later years, he was a free-lance artist in Paris. 

Bompard's Orientalist works depicted scenes from daily life; notably The Butchers of Chetma, which was presented at the Salon in 1890.[1] He also created numerous views of Venice during his stays there.

His works may be seen at the Musée Denys-Puech, the Musée d'Orsay[2] and the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Marseille. The common areas of the Grand Hôtel Broussy in Rodez (lounge and dining room) feature his decorative murals.

Bompard died in Paris in 1936.

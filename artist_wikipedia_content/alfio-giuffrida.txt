Alfio Giuffrida, also known as Alfio Giuffrida AG Sinnwerke (born 28 January 1953 in Zafferana Etnea) is a contemporary Italian sculptor, installation artist, set designer and painter.

In 1975 he returned to non-figurative representation and participated in the X Rome Quadriennale.

Between 1977 and 1985 he worked as a freelance painter and set designer in Rome.

He moved to Cologne in 1986.

From 1990 to 2004 he worked in his studio in Bonn.

2003 saw the founding of the fictitious factory A.G. Sinnwerke®. The first products to appear under the A.G. Sinnwerke label were the CDs, CD-Sets, and Selbstbau-Sets. More concentrated object cycles followed: CD-Roms, Samples, Ovali, Kugeln, Irrigatoren, Mona Lisa, and Sample-Sets, all offered in blister packs. Adjustable, space-consuming sculptures were made in parallel, their models presented in the form of corsets. Many ideas were captured in painting. He followed the same principle when he continued the richly varied idea of the objects in painting : Irrigatoren, Irrigatoren-Sätze, CD-Homes, Figuren, Enthüllungen, Bezüge, Seitenblicke, Antennen, Töpfe, Tempel, Angebote, CD-Stapel, Kathedralen etc. Eventually the artist provided only the material, that is, the Do-it-yourself-Baukästen, allowing the buyer to come to a personal decision about what form to use for his or her individual picture.

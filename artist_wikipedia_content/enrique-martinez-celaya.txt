Martínez Celaya was born on June 9, 1964, in Havana, Cuba, and spent his early childhood in Nueva Paz and Los Palos, Cuba.[3][4][5][6][7][8] His family relocated to Madrid, Spain in 1972. While there, he took up drawing at the age of eight.[9][10][11][12] In 1975, the family relocated again, this time to Puerto Rico.[11] He initiated his formal training as an apprentice to a painter at the age of 12 and developed his early interest in writing and philosophy.[13]

In 1982, he enrolled at Cornell University.[9][11] He graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics and a minor in Electrical Engineering in 1986.[14][9] He was selected as a Regent's Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, and earned a Master of Science degree with a specialization in Quantum Electronics[11] While there, he patented several laser devices.[14][9][10][11][15] He later enrolled in the M.F.A. program at the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduated with highest honors in 1994.[14][9] After graduation, he attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.[9]

About his interest in literature, Martínez Celaya states, “Reading is a primary source for my work." I read philosophy and literature and that is the universe I see my work in, even though I'm a visual artist. ... Often when artists talk about writers, they're talking about them as source of content. I'm reading them for a moral stance in the world.”[16]

Martínez Celaya has created solo museum exhibitions for the Hispanic Society Museum & Library in New York City (2024),[17] the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana, Cuba (2023),[18] and the Marino Marini Museum in Florence, Italy (2023).[19] He has also created projects for the Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California (2021),[20] The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C.

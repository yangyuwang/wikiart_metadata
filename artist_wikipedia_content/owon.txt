Jang Seung-eop (Korean: 장승업; 1843–1897), commonly known by his art name Owon, was a Korean painter of the late Joseon period.[1]

He was one of the few painters to hold a position of rank in the Joseon court. His life was dramatized in the award-winning 2002 film Chi-hwa-seon directed by Im Kwon-taek. 

Jang was orphaned at a young age and grew up in poverty. He stayed at the homes of a number of people, including Yi Eung-hŏn (이응헌; 李應憲), Pyŏn Wŏn-kyu (변원규; 卞元圭), and Oh Kyŏng-sŏk [ko], where he was exposed to art.[1]

Together with the earlier painters Danwon and Hyewon, Jang is remembered today as one of the "Three Wons" of Joseon-period painting.

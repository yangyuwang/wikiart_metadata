He painted portraits of the Empress Elisabeth of Austria, the Prince of Rolian, and Bishop Strossmayer of Zagreb.  He also had an interest in Orientalist subjects as exemplified by  Il Caffè Orientale di Trieste (c. 1888), now on display in the Civic Museum of Oriental Art of Trieste [2] and the Capture of Slaves[3]

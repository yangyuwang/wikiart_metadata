Niele Toroni (born 15 March 1937 in Muralto[1]) is a Swiss painter. He lives and works in Paris.

In 1966 Toroni started a practice he calls "Travail-Peinture".[2] Toroni's method, brushstrokes made with imprints of a no. 50 paintbrush repeated at perpendicular 30 centimeter intervals,[3] was first shown at a debut in 1967 in Paris at an exhibition-performance at the Salon de la Jeune Peinture in the Musèe d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.[4] That same year, Toroni founded the BMPT (art group) together with Daniel Buren, Olivier Mosset, and Michel Parmentier.[5] In works like Miroir d’Eau (1973) and Vert Wagon (1977), the imprints made with a n°50 paintbrush are repeated at regular intervals of 30 cm.[6]

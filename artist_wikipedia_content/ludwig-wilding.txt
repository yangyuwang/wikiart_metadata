Ludwig Wilding (19 May 1927 – 4 January 2010) was a German visual artist, whose work is associated with Op art and Kinetic art. Wilding lived in Düsseldorf, and Westheim, Germany.[1][2]

Wilding was born in Grünstadt, Germany.[3] He studied at the University of Mainz Art School, from 1949 to 1950; and at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart, from 1952 to 1954, under Willi Baumeister.[3][4]

Wilding's works are three-dimensional structures that create shifting patterns through their black and white designs. He has shown at the Museum Leverkusen (1953); Zimmergallery (1958), Frankfurt; and Studio F (1965), Ulm. His work was included in The Responsive Eye (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1965), Eyes, Lies, and Illusions (Hayward Gallery, London, 2004) and Optic Nerve: Perceptual Art of the 1960s (The Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio, 2007).

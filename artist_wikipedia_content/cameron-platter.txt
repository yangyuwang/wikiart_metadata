Cameron Platter (born 1978) is a South African contemporary visual artist.

His work has been described as "unorthodox",[1]  "the delinquent love child of Quentin Tarantino and Dr Seuss"[2] and where "the bizarreness of everyday life comes together in an expression unashamedly unforgiving, yet deeply observant".[3]

Examples are held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York;[4][5][6] the FRAC des Pays de la Loire in France; the Iziko South African National Gallery; the Margulies Collection in Miami, Florida; the Zeitz Collection in South Africa; and the New Church Collection in South Africa.[7]

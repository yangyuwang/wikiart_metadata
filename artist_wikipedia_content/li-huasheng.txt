Li Huasheng (Simplified Chinese: 李华生; Hanyu Pinyin: Lǐ Huáshēng) (1944–2018) was a Chinese artist from Yibin in Sichuan province. He received his first art training in one of Chongqing's culture halls. He met Chen Zizhuang in 1972, and studied traditional Chinese painting under him, mastering his style in just four years.

Li's fame was so great that in 1980, he was invited to showcase his art for Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. In 1985 he was elected an honorary member of the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts, and the following year was accepted into the Sichuan Academy of Poetry, Calligraphy, and Painting.[1]

Li's life has been extensively chronicled in Jerome Silbergeld and Gong Jisui's Contradictions: Artistic Life, The Socialist State, and the Chinese Painter Li Huasheng, and his life has been said to "[epitomize] the path of the artist in socialist China".[2]

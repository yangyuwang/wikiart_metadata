Christinek was born to German parents and was initially taught in German, but lived his whole life in Russia. He painted primarily portraits of Russian aristocracy.  He settled down in St. Petersburg, where he died, c.1794. Among some of his notable works was a mosaic of the Battle of Poltava, produced at the Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg. In 1785, he did a portrait of the architect Yury Felten.

For her solo shows at the Hepworth Wakefield and Tate St Ives in 2013, Sterling collaborated with choreographer Kenneth Tindall of Northern Ballet for a performance piece, The Ultimate Form (2013), inspired by the artist's research into the work of Barbara Hepworth.[5][6]

Sterling was born in Manchester to the late Jean and Thomas Mulvey. She was educated at Upholland Grammar School and studied Graphic Design at Manchester Polytechnic from 1974 to 1977.[2][9]

Sterling's photomontage work was influenced by the punk rock movement; the punk cut-and-paste sensibility provided a vehicle to explore rebellious, gender, commodity critique, and the body. Her collage work was also influenced by the art historical Dadaist heritage, in particular the work of the German artist Hannah Hoch).[10] She cites Dawn Adès' 1976 'Photomontage' as a major influence.[11]


In one of her early works, the cover art for the 1977 single release of "Orgasm Addict" by the punk band the Buzzcocks,[12] the collage depicts a naked woman with an iron for a head and grinning mouths instead of nipples.[12] 
"At this point, men's magazines were either DIY, cars or porn. Women's magazines were fashion or domestic stuff. So, guess the common denominator – the female body. I took the female form from both sets of magazines and made these peculiar jigsaws highlighting these various cultural monstrosities that I felt there were at the time."[13]
Rolling Stone described Sterling's work as "subversive photomontages which splice images from consumer culture and glossy glamour magazines".[11]

Sterling's work has been the subject of numerous international solo exhibitions, including those at the Tate Museum St. Ives,[4] Nottingham Contemporary,[14] Kestnergesellschaft,[4] among others. Her work has been featured in group shows at the Tate Modern,[4] Tate Britain,[4] the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago,[15] Australian Centre for Contemporary Art,[16] among other venues.[4]

Sterling's work is represented by Modern Art, London; Blum & Poe, Los Angeles; and dépendance, Brussels.[8]

In 2018, Sterling was commissioned by Art on the Underground to produce a public art work at Southwark station. The Bower of Bliss, her first large-scale public art piece in London, consisted of an 85-metre long street-level photomontage billboard and a cover commission for the 29th edition of the pocket Tube map.[20] Its launch was marked with a performance art piece in November 2018.[21]

In 1978, Linder founded the post-punk band Ludus, she performed as its singer and front-woman until the band split-up in 1983. She designed many of the group's album covers and sleeves. Ludus' music ranged from post punk to experimental avantgarde jazz to cocktail jazz. Sterling's distinctive vocal quality and techniques (including screaming, unusual sounds and laughter) combined with her lyrics, focused on female desire, alienation, sexual politics and gender roles. The bulk of the band's material was originally released on the indy labels such as New Hormones and Crepuscule.[32][33][34]

Sterling's work is included in the permanent collection of the Tate Modern Museum,[4] the Museum of Modern Art,[35] among others.

Her work during the residency was inspired by the Act of Representation of the People, which gave women over the age of thirty the right to vote.[37][9]

Sterling has a son, Maxwell Sterling.[38] She lives and works in London.[8]

Sterling is a long time friend of The Smiths lead singer, Morrissey, since they met at a Sex Pistols sound check in Manchester in 1976.[39] Sterling was the inspiration for The Smiths' critically acclaimed song "Cemetry Gates."

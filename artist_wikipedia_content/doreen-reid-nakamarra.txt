Doreen Reid Nakamarra (c.1955 â€“ 20 October 2009) was an Australian Aboriginal artist and painter.[2] Reid was considered an important artist within the Western Desert cultural bloc.[2] She was a leading painter at the Papunya Tula artist cooperative in Central Australia.[2]

Reid was born in Mummine near Mirlirrtjarra / Warburton, Western Australia in the mid-1950s.[1] In 1984, Reid and her husband George Tjampu Tjapaltjarri, who subsequently established himself as a Papunya Tula painter, settled at the new community of Kiwirrkurra, to be closer to her husband's country.[2][3][4] In 2007, Reid's work was displayed at the National Gallery of Australia's inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial: Culture Warriors exhibition. The exhibit, including Reid's pieces, toured Australia state galleries before opening at the Katzen Arts Center in Washington D.C. in September 2009.[2]

Additionally, Reid's work was featured at the Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art in 2009.[2] She was awarded the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award general painting prize in 2008 for an untitled work.[1][2] The work depicts designs associated with the Marrapinti rockhole site, west of the Pollock Hills in Western Australia.[5]

In September 2009, Reid travelled to New York City for the opening of a Papunya Tula art exhibition which included her work.[2] The New York exhibition was opened by Hetti Perkins, the curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney.[2]

Reid died a few weeks after returning from a major exhibition in the United States of America (USA). On 18 October 2009, Reid was admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia.[2] She was flown from Alice Springs to Adelaide, where she died in the hospital on 20 October 2009, at the age of 50.[2]

Paul Sweeney, the general manager of Papunya Tula, praised Reid as an important artist and spokesperson.[2]

Georg Tappert  (20 October 1880, in Berlin – 16 November 1957, in Berlin) was a German expressionist painter.

Tappert underwent an apprenticeship as a tailor, before gaining employment at various tailoring businesses for two years. However he attracted the attention of Max Liebermann, who gave him a letter of introduction to Ludwig Schmid-Reutte a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe.[1] He studied there from 1901 to 1906, whereupon he joined the Worpswede artists’ colony until 1909.[2]

He was one of the founders of the New Secession which was formed in 1910 following 27 expressionist artworks being excluded from an exhibition organised by the Berlin Secession.

Tadashi Nakayama (中山 正, Nakayama Tadashi, born 1927 Niigata, Niigata, died 2014) was a Japanese woodblock print artist, working in a style that combines influences from traditional Japanese ukiyo-e prints and Western painting.

He studied oil painting at Tama Art College but left in 1947.[1][2][3]

From 1962 to 1965 he lived in Milan, Italy and then England.[1][4] He taught at Bath Academy of Arts.[1]

Motifs in his work include butterflies, horses, cranes, and girls with long flowing hair.[1][5][6][7][8] Some of his later pieces were inspired by Persian, Byzantine and Renaissance styles.[3]

Vytautas Kairiūkštis (Polish: Witold Kajruksztis, 1890 in Sejny – 1961 in Vilnius) was a Lithuanian constructivist artist.

From 1910 to 1911 Kairiukstis  attended the Vilnius Drafting School.

In 1923 Kairiūkštis organised the New Art Exhibition which lasted from May 20 to June 20.[1] In this he was aided by Władysław Strzemiński, who had moved to Vilnius the year before. This was the first avant-garde art exhibition in Lithuania and featured Cubist, Constructivist, and Suprematist works.[1]

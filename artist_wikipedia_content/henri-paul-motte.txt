Henri-Paul Motte (French pronunciation: [ɑ̃ʁi pɔl mɔt]; 13 December 1846 – 1 April 1922) was a French artistic painter from Paris, who specialised in history painting and historical genre.

Motte was a pupil of the artist Jean-Léon Gérôme and began to exhibit at the Paris Salon from 1874 onwards. The painting Le cheval de Troie (The Trojan horse) was the artist's début at the Salon, and was acquired by the Wadsworth Atheneum in 2011.[1] In 1892 he was made a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur. He won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle (1900). He is best known for his work of the Siege of La Rochelle, a depiction of Cardinal Richelieu in battle during the 17th century, completed in 1881.

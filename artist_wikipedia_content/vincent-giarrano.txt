Vincent Giarrano (born November 17, 1960), also known as Vince Giarrano, is an American contemporary realist painter and former comic book artist.

Vincent Giarrano was born on November 17, 1960[1] in Buffalo, New York. He took an early interest in drawing and by the time he was 12, decided to pursue a career as an artist.[2]

He went on to complete his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University at Buffalo in 1982[1] and a Master of Fine Arts from Syracuse University in 1985.[1] Subsequently, he worked as an illustrator for Marvel Comics[3] and DC Comics,[4] among others. Giarrano credits his years of experience drawing comic books with developing a sense of the narrative structure.[5]

Around 2000, Giarrano again started to take an active interest in fine arts, particularly in realist painting.[2] He meticulously studied the works of John Singer Sargent, attended workshops and painted with friends.[2] From the middle of the decade his works started to appear in Group and Solo Exhibitions fairly frequently.[6] His works have been exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.,[7] and National Portrait Gallery, London.[7]

Giarrano often paints the ubiquitous experiences from everyday lives, believing these fleeting moments can carry something of infinite significance. He also puts a lot of importance on effectively capturing light and creating a moody atmosphere.[2]

Besides John Singer Sargent, other painters like Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, Anders Zorn and Edward Hopper have influenced Giarrano.[2] He is also inspired by the courage and commitment of Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.[5]

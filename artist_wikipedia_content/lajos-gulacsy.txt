Lajos Gulácsy (12 October 1882 – 21 February 1932) was a Hungarian painter with works collected by the Hungarian National Gallery. Heavily influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, his rather dreamlike work is associated with Art Nouveau and Symbolism, but can also be considered a prelude to Surrealism.[1]

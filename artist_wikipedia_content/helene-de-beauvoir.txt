Henriette-Hélène de Beauvoir (French pronunciation: [ɑ̃ʁjɛt elɛn də bovwaʁ]; 6 June 1910 – 1 July 2001) was a French painter. She was the younger sister of philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. Her art was exhibited in Europe, Japan, and the US.[1] She married Lionel de Roulet.[2]

When Hélène de Beauvoir lived in Goxwiller, a village near Strasbourg, she became president of the center for battered women. She continued painting until she was 85. Many of her paintings were related to feminist philosophy and women's issues.[3]

In January 2025, art dealer Amar Singh staged the first UK solo exhibition of Hélène de Beauvoir's work at Amar Gallery.[4] Harper's Bazaar writing about the exhibition stated "The show offers a mere glimpse through the keyhole of her expansive artistry, but it’s the most we’ve ever seen of de Beauvoir in this country: jewel-like landscapes, teetering on the brink of abstraction; canvases smeared with energy and passion."[5]

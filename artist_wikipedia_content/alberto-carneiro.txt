This anthropological vision of artistic creativity is combined with an approach to the Eastern philosophies of the essence and nature (Zen Buddhism, Tantra) and take you to draw up the 'Manifesto of Ecological Art' '(1968-72) that rejects the Western dualism sensuality / spirituality and promotes the rehabilitation of the easiest things in the mean of aesthetic communication .[4]

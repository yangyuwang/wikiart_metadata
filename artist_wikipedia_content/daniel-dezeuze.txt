Daniel Dezeuze (born 1942) is a French artist and a founding member of the French group of artists called Supports/Surfaces. This group (made up of Dezeuze, Claude Viallat, Patrick Saytour, Louis Cane, André-Pierre Arnal, Vincent Bioulès, Noêl Dolla, Jean-Pierre Pincemin, André Valensi, Marc Devade, Toni Grand, and Bernard Pagès) started to form in 1966. Their common concern was a desire to deconstruct painting in order to re-examine its history and question its nature. Colour is a fundamental question in many of their works. They frequently used non-traditional materials and referred to other non-western cultures.[1][2][3]

Jules-Alexandre Grün (25 May 1868 – 15 February 1938) was a French Post-Impressionist painter, poster artist, and illustrator.[1]

Grun's best known painting is called The Dinner Party, produced in 1911. It was, however, in the fields of poster art and illustration art, for which he was famous. He was employed at a large printing company in Paris and his artistic director was Jules Chéret. Chéret was also his main competitor in poster art.[1]

Johannes Carolus Bernardus (Jan) Sluijters, or Sluyters (17 December 1881 in 's-Hertogenbosch â€“ 8 May 1957 in Amsterdam) was a Dutch painter and co-founder of the Moderne Kunstkring.

Sluijters (in English often spelled "Sluyters") was a leading pioneer of various Post-Impressionist movements in the Netherlands.[1] He experimented with several styles, including Fauvism and Cubism, finally settling on a colorful expressionism. His paintings feature nude studies, portraits, landscapes, and still lifes. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.[2]

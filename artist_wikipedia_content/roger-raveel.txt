Roger Henri Kamiel, Knight Raveel (15 July 1921 – 30 January 2013) was a Belgian painter, whose work is often associated with pop art because of its depiction of everyday objects. Raveel's style evolved throughout his career, from abstract to figurative.[1][2][3]

Raveel was born in Machelen-aan-de-Leie, Belgium, and trained in the academies of Ghent and Deinze.[2] After 1952 he began to use large white spaces. A central theme in his work was the opposition of fiction and reality. In 1976 he created a large wall painting in the Brussels metro station Mérode. Portraits of his first wife and favourite model Zulma, to whom he was married until her death in 2009, were a running motif throughout his work.

Raveel died on 30 January 2013 in Deinze, at the age of 91.[2] On 15 July 2016, Google Doodle commemorated his 95th birthday.[4]

Frederick John Eversley (born 1941) is an American sculptor who lives in SoHo, New York, and for many years, as a Venice Beach resident, was associated with the California Light and Space movement. He is recognized for his "centripetal casting" process and for being a pioneer Black abstractionist. His parabolic resin sculptures have been exhibited in more than 200 galleries and museums worldwide.[1]

Eversley was born in New York and raised in East New York, in Brooklyn. [2] His father, Frederick W. Eversley Jr., was a civil engineer at Republic Aviation for more than 20 years, and the founder of a minority-owned construction business that played a key role in building the New York State Office Building in Harlem, a Rockefeller University faculty residential tower, the Bronx Zoo World of Darkness building, and others.[3][4] 
His mother, Beatrice Syphax Eversley, a school teacher and PTA leader,[2][5]traces her ancestry to the Arlington, Virginia Syphax family.[6] Maria Carter Syphax, a slave, was the daughter of George Washington Parke Custis, George Washington's stepson, and received seventeen acres inside the Arlington plantation.[6][5]

The eldest of four children, Eversley has one sister Rani Eversley, and two brothers, Donald Eversley and Thomas Eversley.[6] In addition, Eversley has both a German Jewish and a Shinnecock grandmother. [5]

Eversley was first attracted to the parabola form as child reading about Isaac Newton and his experiments.[5][7] He tinkered in his father's electronics basement workshop,[2] playing with his grandfather’s radio and photography equipment to emulate scientific theories.[7]

Eversley attended Brooklyn Technical High School, and worked at Izzy Young’s Folklore Center in Greenwich Village with Marcia Silverman Tucker, who would be responsible years later for giving Eversley his first art show in New York.[5][2]

Eversley went to college at  Carnegie Mellon, where he majored in electrical engineering and was the only Black engineering student.[8][9] He did not take one art class at Carnegie Mellon.[10][5] In 2023, Eversley received a Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Carnegie Mellon.[8]

From 1963 to 1967, Eversley worked as an engineer at Wyle Laboratories, where he was part of the team that designed high intensity acoustic laboratories for NASA Houston (APOLLO and GEMINI missions), and for the European Space Agency (Munich).[1][4][11]

He moved to Venice, California, in 1964, where he would live for more than 50 years.[4]

In 1967, he retired from engineering to become a full-time artist after a down-the-hill car accident almost cost him his life; he broke his femur and had to walk on crutches for more than one year.[5]

In 1969, Eversley assumed John Altoon's Venice studio that Frank Gehry converted from a laundromat into a live-work space. Kiana and DeWain Valentine were his neighbors,[5][2] as well as  other Los Angeles artists, including  Larry Bell, Robert Irwin, Charles Maddox, John McCracken, and James Turrell.[4][11][1]

In 1977, Eversley was nominated and selected as the first artist in residence of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.[7]
As part of his three-year residency, he was given a large studio workspace in the museum's basement and a living space at Barney Studio House (now the Latvian Embassy).[12] Sam Gilliam was one of his neighbors.[9] In DC, Eversley had shows at the American Institute of Architects headquarters, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the National Academy of Sciences.[9]

In 1980, Eversley purchased a five-story, cast iron building in SoHo as an investment.[2] In 2019, he was forced out of his Venice studio and moved back to New York, where he now lives with his artist wife, Maria Larsson.[13]

Eversley is a pioneer among Black abstractionists[14] and creates sculptures from cast resin and other materials.[15] He refers to his process as “centripetal casting,” where he uses a mold instead of his hands to shape the sculpture's form into a parabola.[5] His work focuses on the use of space and light, connecting people through positive energy spaces,[14] and working with the Earth's natural resources to create art.[16]
He uses basic geometric forms to play with light refraction and incorporates parabolic curves to evoke thick lens and mirror images.[17] In the 1970s, Eversley was considered to be a part of the California Light and Space movement.[5]

Eversley sold his first major work to the National Museum of American Art, to be included in an international traveling show.[9]

His work appears in the permanent collections of more than 30 museums around the world,[8] including Crystal Bridges Museum,[2] K11 Art Foundation in Hong Kong,[8] Los Angeles County Museum of Art, [8] Museum of Modern Art in New York,[8] Oakland Museum of California,[10] Smithsonian American Art Museum,[10] Tate Modern,[8]
and Whitney Museum of American Art,[18] as well as the private collections of Michael Dell,[5] Monica Lewinsky's family,[5] and Raymond J. McGuire.[9]

Edith "Edie" Vonnegut (born 1949 in Schenectady, New York) is an American painter.[1]

Her work—most of which juxtaposes heavenly beings and mundane activities—has been showcased at galleries across the United States,[2] and is featured in the book Domestic Goddesses, along with her humorous commentary.[3]

Vonnegut is the daughter of novelist Kurt Vonnegut and his first wife, Jane Marie (Cox),[4][5] and the sister of Mark Vonnegut and Nanette Vonnegut. Her paternal grandmother is Edith Lieber Vonnegut.[4] She grew up in Barnstable, Massachusetts and her parents supported her desire to become an artist.[6] She graduated from Boston Museum School of Fine Arts and University of Iowa.[2]

When her father became famous she got swept into the limelight with him, living in New York City for fifteen years until returning to Cape Cod to start a family. While initially concerned having children would doom her career as an artist, it turned out to be a fertile source for her painting.[6] Since 1985, she has been married to John Squibb;[6] they have two sons together.[2]

She was once married to television personality Geraldo Rivera and has published under the names Edith Vonnegut, Edith Vonnegut Rivera, and Edith Vonnegut Squibb.[7][8]

Vonnegut studied transcendental meditation with her mother, Jane, in 1967.[9]

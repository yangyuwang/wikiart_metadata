Camille Graeser (27 February 1892, Carouge – 21 February 1980, Wald) was a Swiss painter and member of the circle of Zurich Concrete artists.[1][2] He was born in Switzerland but grew up in Stuttgart, Germany where he became a furniture designer. He took part in major exhibitions by the association Werkbund and in 1927 was invited to create furniture for Mies van der Rohe.[3] In 1933 he fled to Switzerland as a result of the Nazis coming to power.[2] He then became a member of the Swiss artists’ association Allianz.[1]

The Camille Graeser Foundation was established in 1981, and is responsible for his artistic estate.[4]

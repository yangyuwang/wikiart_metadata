Kristoffer Zetterstrand (born 27 September 1973) is a Swedish surrealist artist, known for creating most of Minecraft's paintings.

Kristoffer Zetterstrand studied at Royal University College of Fine Arts in Stockholm and the Facultad de Bellas Artes in Madrid.[1] Zetterstrand's works are influenced by both classical and Renaissance artwork, as well as computer graphics and 3D modeling.[2] His debut exhibition in 2002 consisted of compilations for the game Counter-Strike. In 2010, Markus Persson, Zetterstrand's former brother-in-law, included some of Zetterstrand's paintings in his game Minecraft,[1]  a sandbox and survival game inspired by Infiniminer. Since then, these paintings have become an iconic part of the game. In June 2024, Mojang Studios collaborated with Zetterstrand to add fifteen more paintings to Minecraft in commemoration of the game's fifteenth anniversary.[3] His paintings are often based on virtual still lifes and scenography sculpted in 3D applications, and he has broadened his sources of images to include vintage photography and imagery.[4]

In 2008, Zetterstrand received the IASPIS artist in residency grant. In 2012, he received the Marianne & Sigvard Bernadotte Art Award.[5] In 2013, he was awarded the Stora Kakelpriset, an annual prize for the most innovative use of tiles or ceramics in construction in Sweden, for his mosaic Ager Medicinae (The Medical Landscape).[6][7] The work is 340 square metres (3,700 sq ft) in size and was commissioned for the exterior of the parking garage at New Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. It depicts a rough timeline of the development of medicine in pixellated style.[8]

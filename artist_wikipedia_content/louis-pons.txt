Louis Pons (30 April 1927 – 12 January 2021) was a French collage artist. He specialised in reliefs and assemblages made entirely from discarded objects and junk.[1] In Agnès Varda's documentary The Gleaners and I, Pons explains his artistic process and understanding of art; what others see as "a cluster of junk," he sees as "a cluster of possibilities;"[2] and that the function of art is to tidy up one's inner and exterior worlds.[1]

Pons was born on 30 April 1927.[3] He died on 12 January 2021, at the age of 93.[4]

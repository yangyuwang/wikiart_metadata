Xavier Mellery (9 August 1845, Laken – 4 February 1921, Brussels) was a Belgian symbolist painter.

The son of a gardener at the Royal Palace of Laeken, Mellery initially worked with the painter-decorator Charles Albert. He attended the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Brussels from 1860 to 1867, one of his professors being Jean-François Portaels. Mellery won the Prix de Rome and traveled to Italy where he studied paintings from the Renaissance.[1] His works include The Rondo of the Hours.

Mellery designed the statues of all 48 historical professions in the Petit Sablon/Kleine Zavel garden in Brussels, though they were executed by different sculptors. Each pillar has a unique design, as does each section of fence.[2]

1885: Knight in the Order of Leopold.[3]

Frank Cadogan Cowper RA RWS RP RWA (16 October 1877 – 17 November 1958)[1] was an English painter and illustrator of portraits, historical and literary scenes, also described as "The Last Pre-Raphaelite".[2][3][4]

Frank Cadogan Cowper was born in Wicken, Northamptonshire, the son of an author and early pioneer of coastal cruising in yachts, Frank Cowper, and grandson of Edward Cadogan, the Rector of Wicken.

Cadogan Cowper was educated at Cranleigh before going on to study art, first at St John's Wood Art School in 1896 and then at the Royal Academy Schools from 1897 to 1902.[5] He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1899 and achieved critical acclaim two years later with his An Aristocrat Answering the Summons to Execution, Paris 1791 (1901). In 1902, Cadogan Cowper spent six months as an apprentice helping Edwin Austin Abbey RA complete a monumental canvas painting The Coronation of King Edward VII (now in the Royal Collection) before travelling to Italy to continue his studies.[6][7]

Cadogan Cowper worked in oils, tempera and watercolours, and simultaneously worked as a book illustrator, providing the illustrations for Sir Sidney Lee's The Imperial Shakespeare. He contributed to a mural in the Houses of Parliament in 1910-12 along with John Byam Liston Shaw, Ernest Board and Henry Arthur Payne.[8][9][10][11]

As art trends changed, Cadogan Cowper increasingly exhibited his portrait paintings and still continued to produce historical and literary works of art.[12][13]

Cadogan Cowper retired from London and moved to Gloucestershire. One of his paintings, The Ugly Duckling, was voted "their favourite painting" by visitors to the Cheltenham Art Gallery & Museum in 2005.[14]

The record price for a Cadogan Cowper painting at sale is £469,250 for Our Lady of the Fruits of the Earth (1917) at Christie's in London on 17 December, 2011.[15]

The National Gallery of London is staging an exhibition Saint Francis of Assisi which includes the work of Frank Cadogan Cowper until 30 July, 2023.[16][17]

In February 2024, the Musei di San Domenico in Forlì, Italy, will host the exhibition Pre-Raphaelites: A Modern Renaissance that will feature the work of Cadogan Cowper Vanity.[18]

Henry William Banks Davis RA (1833 – 1 December 1914[1]) was a popular English landscape and animal painter, noted for his pastoral scenes, often populated with cattle and other farm animals.

He studied and exhibited at the Royal Academy, becoming an associate in 1873 and Royal Academician in 1877, and where he was awarded two silver medals.[2]

Early works were influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites but he later evolved a more individual style and worked on a larger scale. He achieved popularity and his art commanded high prices during his lifetime.[3]

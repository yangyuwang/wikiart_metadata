Lawrence Charles Weiner (February 10, 1942 – December 2, 2021) was an American  artist. He was one of the central figures in the formation of Conceptual Art in the 1960s.[1] Since 1968, he explored the potential of language in reference to material as a sculptural medium, marking a seminal shift in the material qualities and presentation of art.[1]  His work has the unique ability to be presented in various formats, all equally regarded by the artist: installed as text on a wall, presented via printed matter, captured in a film, spoken aloud, recorded, remembered, or performed.[1] Weiner divided his time between his studio practice in New York City and his boat in Amsterdam. He participated in public and private projects in the new and old world maintaining that:
"ART IS NOT A METAPHOR UPON THE RELATIONSHIPS OF HUMAN BEINGS TO OBJECTS & OBJECTS TO OBJECTS IN RELATION TO HUMAN BEINGS BUT A REPRESENTATION OF AN EMPIRICAL EXISTING FACT" [2]
Lawrence Charles Weiner was born on February 10, 1942, in Manhattan, to Toba Horowitz and Harold Weiner.[3] His parents owned a candy store.[3] After graduating from Stuyvesant High School at 16 in 1958,[4] he studied philosophy and literature[5] at Hunter College for less than a year. He went on to traveled throughout North America before eventually returning to New York.[6]


Before beginning to use language as a sculptural medium, Weiner produced two distinct series of paintings in the 1960s: Propellor Paintings (1964-1966) and Removal Paintings (1966-1968). These painting series were concerned with “idea of painting rather than a painting”, but are still inherently bound to the phenomenological status of a particular object, a paradoxical issue.[2] Weiner’s sculpture STAPLES, STAKES, TWINE, TURF produced for the outdoor group exhibition "Carl Andre, Robert Barry, Lawrence Weiner" at Windham College in 1968 instigated a seminal revision of Weiner’s mode of production. The work was destroyed by the group to which Weiner’s work addressed—the students—as it was an imposition on their space.[1] Alice Zimmerman Weiner recounts that the “work had trespassed a boundary that Weiner had not been aware of and prompted him “to reflect on the implications of imposing structures on an unknown public”.[1] Weiner later declared that:
“A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION SEEMS TO BE THAT / PROLONGED NEGOTIATIONS WITH A NON- / ACCOMMODATING STRUCTURE IS NOT THE ROLE / & / OR USE OF THE ARTIST OR THE ART.”.[2]
This incident prompted Weiner to realize that an artwork need not impose on physical space at all and Weiner began to utilize language as a primary material—the work “had become a manifestation of ‘language + the materials referred to’”.[1] Weiner asserted that by utilizing language, “there is no edge that the picture drops over or drops off. You are dealing with something completely infinite.”.[2] Further, the use of language is egalitarian as it is accessible to all and transcends cultural barriers via translation. Joseph Kosuth aptly stated that Weiner “changed his notion of ‘place’… from the context of the canvas (which could only be specific) to a context which was ‘general’, yet all the while continuing his concern with specific materials and processes.”.[7]

From 1968 onwards, Weiner’s work operated under the conditions dictated by the "Declaration of Intent", first presented in the magazine Art News in the fall of 1968 and in the "January 5-31,1969" exhibition catalog.[7] The "Declaration of Intent" often accompanied Weiner's work:

1. THE ARTIST MAY CONSTRUCT THE PIECE

2. THE PIECE MAY BE FABRICATED

3. THE PIECE NEED NOT BE BUILT


EACH BEING EQUAL AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE ARTIST THE DECISION AS TO CONDITION RESTS WITH THE RECEIVER UPON THE OCCASION OF RECEIVERSHIP
The first condition recalls the traditional relationship between the artist and the artwork. The second condition permits the linguistic statement to be ‘fabricated’ by someone other than the artist. Weiner uses the general term ‘receiver’ for any individual, collector, gallery, or museum who accepted the responsibility of ownership under these conditions.[7]

Weiner's first body of work produced within this novel framework was the solo-exhibition Statements, an artist's book published in December 1968 by The Louis Kellner Foundation and Seth Siegelaub. Statements consists of twenty-four works, condensed linguistic statements that describe sculptural processes and common materials of production. In an interview with Benjamin Buchloh, Weiner asserted that the work in Statements is “decidedly non-macho, but [turns] out to be the tough guy in the bar.”.[2]

A comprehensive retrospective of Weiner's nearly 50-year career was organized by Ann Goldstein and Donna De Salvo at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA) and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York in 2007–2008. Major solo exhibitions of the artist's work have been mounted at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1988/89), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C. (1990), Institute of Contemporary Arts, London (1991), Dia Center for the Arts, New York (1991), Musée d'Art Contemporain, Bordeaux (1991/92), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1992), The Arnhem (Sonsbeek) The Netherlands (1993) Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (1994), Philadelphia Museum of Art (1994), Museum Ludwig, Cologne (1995), Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin (2000), Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo in Mexico City (2004), Tate Gallery in London (2006),[6] The Jewish Museum, NY (2012),[8] Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria (2016),[9] and the Nivola Museum, Orani, Italy (2019).[10] He participated in Documenta V (1972), VI (1977), and VII (1982), as well as the 2005 Venice Biennale, the Biennale de São Paulo in 2006, the Venice Biennale and European Cultural Centre [11] in 2013 with his work 'The Grace of a Gesture'.[12]

Among his many honors were National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships (1976 and 1983), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1994), Wolfgang Hahn Prize (1995), a Skowhegan Medal for Painting/Conceptual Art (1999), An Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the Graduate Center, City University of New York City, (2013),[22] the Roswitha Haftmann Prize, Zurich, Switzerland (2015),[23] and the Aspen Award for Art (2017).[24] On the occasion of the Drawing Center's 2012 Spring Gala, where Weiner was being honored for his contributions to contemporary art, fellow artist Ed Ruscha and Mason Williams created a three-minute tribute in the form of a parody of Bob Dylan's legendary music video for "Subterranean Homesick Blues" with placards featuring Weiner text pieces like "stars don't stand still in the sky" and "water in milk exists."[25]

Weiner and his wife Alice[26] lived on Bleecker Street for over thirty years before moving to another residence and studio also in the West Village,[27] in what was once an old laundromat built in 1910 and was transformed into a five-level town house designed by the firm LOT-EK in 2008.[28]

Weiner died on December 2, 2021, in Manhattan, at the age of 79.[3][29]

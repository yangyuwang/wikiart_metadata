Paul Peel (7 November 1860 – 3 October 1892) was a Canadian figure painter. Having won a medal at the 1890 Paris Salon, he became  one of the first Canadian artists to receive international recognition in his lifetime.[1]

Peel was born in London, Canada West, and received his art training from his father from a young age.[2] His sister Mildred Peel was also an artist.[3] Later he studied with William Lees Judson and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with Thomas Eakins (1877-1880). [2] Like fellow graduates of the Pennsylvania Academy of Arts and students of Eakins, Paul subscribed to a tonal method of rendering natural light outdoors.[4]

He moved to Paris in 1881, France where he studied at the École nationale supérieure des Arts Decoratifs, later enrolling in the atelier of Jean-Léon Gérôme at the École des Beaux-Arts. It was at the recommendation of Gérôme that he began sketching outdoors.[4]

He studied afterwards with Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant in his private atelier and then with him at the Académie Julian as well as with Henri Doucet and Jules Lefebvre (1877-1890).[2] In 1883, he exhibited his first painting at the Paris Salon, where he would continue to exhibit regularly until 1892. His paintings have a conservative quality, but a few later works reveal that he was a convert to Impressionist colour and light.

In 1882, he married Isaure Verdier. They had two children: a son (Robert Andre, in 1886) and a daughter (Emilie Marguerite, in 1888).[2]

Peel travelled widely in Canada and in Europe, exhibiting as a member of the Ontario Society of Artists and the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.[5] He also exhibited at international shows like the Paris Salon, where he won a bronze medal in 1890 for his painting After the Bath.[2] He was known for his often sentimental nudes and for his pictures of the charm of children.[4] Childhood effectively became the artist's "brand" with the public success of After the Bath.[6] He was also among the first Canadian painters to explore the nude as a subject.[7]

He contracted a lung infection and died in his sleep, in Paris, France, at the age of 31.[2]

His childhood home is one of the many attractions at the Fanshawe Pioneer Village in London, Ontario.

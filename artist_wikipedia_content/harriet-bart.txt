Harriet Bart is a Minneapolis-based conceptual artist, known for her objects, installations, and artists books.

Harriet Bart was born in 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, and earned a degree in textiles from the University of Minnesota in 1976.

Harriet Bart creates evocative content through the narrative power of objects, the theater of installation, and the intimacy of artists books. She has a deep and abiding interest in the personal and cultural expression of memory; it is at the core of her work. Using bronze and stone, wood and paper, books and words, everyday and found objects, Bart's work signifies a site, marks an event, and draws attention to imprints of the past as they live in the present. She was the twenty-year collaborator of German artist Helmut LÃ¶hr until his death. Bart has been working collaboratively with Boston-based artist Yu-Wen Wu since 2010.

Bart's work has been exhibited extensively throughout the United States and Germany, and she has completed more than a dozen public art commissions in the United States, Japan, and Israel.  She has been the recipient of fellowships from the Bush Foundation, McKnight Foundation, MacDowell Colony, Virginia Center for Creative Arts, NEA Arts Midwest, and the Minnesota State Arts Board. Since 2000, Bart has published eleven artists books and has won three Minnesota Book Awards, most recently in 2015 for Ghost Maps. Her work is represented in notable collections, including the Jewish Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Public Library, Library of Congress, National Gallery of Art, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Weisman Art Museum, Yale University Art Gallery, Sackner Archive of Visual and Concrete Poetry. She is a guest lecturer, curator, and founding member 
WARM and the Traffic Zone Center for Visual Art in Minneapolis, MN.

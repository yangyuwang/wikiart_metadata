Adolf Eberle (11 January 1843 – 24 January 1914) was a German painter who specialised in genre painting, particularly of Bavarian and Tyrolean farmers and huntsmen.

Eberle was born in Munich; his father, Robert Eberle, was also a painter.[1] At the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, he studied under Karl von Piloty beginning in 1860.[1][2] He achieved success the following year with a painting called Pfändung der letzten Kuh (mortgaging the last cow),[3] of which William Unger made an engraving.[1]

After spending some time depicting soldiers in the Thirty Years' War and the Seven Years' War, he returned to subjects from Bavarian and Tyrolean peasant life.[4] At the 1879 international exposition in Munich, his Erster Rehbock (first stag) was well received.[1] A painting of his with the translated title Childhood Fun was sold for $16,800 at Bonhams in San Francisco in 2007,[5] and another with the translated title The Day's Bag for £7,500 at Christie's in London in 2012.[6]

Eberle died in Munich in 1914.[2] In 1952 Eberlestraße in the Solln neighbourhood of Munich was named after him.[7]

You can use `uv sync` after installation of uv, to syncronize all the requirements of the scraping. For jupyter notebook, please use the `.venv` generated by uv.

## Usage
1. Ensure all required packages are installed.
2. Run `ARTIST_ARTWORKS_SCRAPING.ipynb` to scrape artist and artwork information.
3. Run `ARTWORK_SCRAPING.ipynb` to scrape detailed artwork information.

## Notes
- The scraping process may take a significant amount of time due to the large number of artists and artworks.
- Ensure that the Geckodriver version is compatible with the installed Firefox version.
